Students will engage skills ranging from technical (e.g. network visualizations and Python-based Jupyter notebooks) to listening and dialogue skills used in community engagement.  All backgrounds and skill levels are welcome.  Participants may join for a single workshop or for all three.

Littlesis is a free database of who-knows-who at the heights of business and government. It's used by journalists and activists to analyze the rich & powerful connections and financial transactions.

Public Lab pursues environmental justice through community science and open technology. Their current research focus is on mine reclamation to support local organizers in West Virginia and others organizing against extractive land uses anywhere.

Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI) is a multidisciplinary and cross-professional collaborative that documents and analyzes changes to environmental data, information and overall governance, and advocates for more just and effective policies and practices.
