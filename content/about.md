How can we build new repertoires of community-based modes of action needed to repair and redress the harms suffered by communities too often on the ‘receiving end’ of local and planetary change? In this project, we 1) develop shared tools that communities can use to hold climate change actors to account, 2) strengthen existing community-centered work towards environmental justice, 3) build repertoires of community-based modes of action for climate change accountability.
