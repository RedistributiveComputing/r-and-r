And when we rock up on webhooks we rock the hooks (Right)
How can we build new repertoires of collective action, community-based modes of action needed to repair and redress the harms suffered by communities too often on the ‘receiving end’ of local and planetary change? This proposal works from two ends: episteme and accountability (built around shared tools with which communities can hold climate change actors to account). Our new epistemes are brought into being through thoughtful and sustained scholarship and reflection on how to live sustainably now.
They are presented as narratives. Our new accountabilities rely on creating collaboration tools with communities challenged and disempowered by the differential impacts of environmental change. They manifest as sociotechnical (software) platforms.
